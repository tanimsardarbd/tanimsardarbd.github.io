								<p>The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said

								one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were, last

								seventy-four million four hundred and forty thousand times. If no actual
								disorganization should happen, a drunken person might live until his pulse
								beat this number of times; but by the constant stimulus of ardent spirits,
								or by pulse-quickening food, or tobacco, the pulse becomes greatly
								accelerated, and the two billion five hundred and seventy-four million
